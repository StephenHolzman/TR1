## General
Third try for package's first submission to CRAN. This version is modified to account for the comments from Kurt Hornik (changed title case, and shortened version)

## Test environments
* local Linux Mint install
* win-builder 

## R CMD check results

I ran devtools::check() and received no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs 
I checked the log file from win-builder and there were also no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs
